Pars Local Player (PLP) 2.1
==========================

Pars Local Player (PLP) is a lightweight and reliable media player
developed by the ParrotHat Foundation.

PLP was created as a clean alternative to existing media players
that felt outdated, buggy, or unreliable — especially when playing
internet radio streams and mixed media formats.


FEATURES
--------

- Video and audio playback using QtMultimedia with FFmpeg backend
- Hardware-accelerated decoding (DX11 / VAAPI when available)
